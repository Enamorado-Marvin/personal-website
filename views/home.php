          My two passions are my family and coding. When I am not with my family, I am in front of my computer creating things. With my family, I like to visit places, play with the kids outside or sometimes we play Minecraft.</p>
        <p>
          I have worked in very interesting projects. Most of them have to do with front-end and back-end web development. I built a website with a simple control panel where users can manage their catalog of products.

          In this site, I have my personal information as a homepage, and the other part has my completed assignments for my CS 313 class.
